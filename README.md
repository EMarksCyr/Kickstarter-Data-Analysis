# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Background
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who wanted to use a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. Before launching the campaign, she requested an analysis of data on a pool of crowdfunding campaigns for a variety of project types to seek out potential predictors for success. After her campaign quickly came close to its fundraising goal, she requested an analysis of the funding goals, launch dates, and outcomes of campaigns for other plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this set of analysis is to visualize the outcomes of play campaigns across in relation to launch dates and funding goals to show Louise how different campaigns faired. These visual depictions will make any relationships that may exist between the two predictors and their outcome easier to see. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to look at the relationship between launch dates and campaign outcomes, I needed to create a pivot table that displayed the frequency at which each campaign outcome occurred across each month of the year. This pivot table needed to have the option of filtering by year and parent category, so I used the YEAR() function to extract the year from launch dates that I had previously converted from Unix timestamps to readable dates. I did so using the code `=(((cell/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)`. Next, I created a pivot table based on the data filtered by Parent Category and Years with outcomes in the columns and launch dates in the rows.

I filtered this table to show the successful, failed and cancelled outcomes and groups the launch dates by month. Trying to group by month was a challenge because I did not know how to do this. Reading the [excel documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-or-ungroup-data-in-a-pivottable-c9d1ddd0-6580-47d1-82bc-c84a5a340725?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)
 was very helpful, though, and I followed the instructions presented and figured it out.  I then filtered this pivot table to show results for campaigns within the theatre subcategory because these were the campaigns relevant to Louise and sorted the campaigns in descending order so that the number of successful campaigns would appear first. ![pivot table](/screenshots/Launchdatapivottable.PNG)
Lastly, I created a line chart to display the relationship between outcomes and launch month, which can be seen in the resources file. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next, I needed to look at the relationship between a campaign's initial funding goal and its outcome. To do so, I created a new sheet in the excel workbook where I could summarize the frequency of each campaign outcome within different goal ranges.  I ran the `COUNTIFS()` function on the original Kickstarter sheet data after filtering it for only campaigns in the subcategory 'plays.' I found this task to be very challenging initially. I thought I had used the `COUNTIFS()` function properly, but my numbers did not seem to match up with the sample chart presented in the instructions after I completed the table. I compared each value in the example table to the values in my pivot chart and to the values in the original data. I noticed that, while the example table showed 0 instances of cancelled campaigns, I had a large number of them in my chart. I then realized that, although I had filtered my data, the function was counting data from the entire data set. To solve this, I copied the filtered, original data over to a new sheet and named it "Kickstarterplays." I then referenced this sheet in formulas, for example,`=COUNTIFS(Kickstartersplays!$D:$D,"<1000",Kickstartersplays!$F:$F,"successful")`. My table then looked much more inline with the filtered data. Next, I used the `SUM()` function to get the total number of projects in each goal range (e.g., `=SUM(B2:D2)`). Lastly, I divided each outcome count by the total number of projects in its goal range (e.g., `=(B2/$E2)`) to calculate the percentage of each outcome within the range; I formatted the cells from decimal values to percent style (ctrl+shift+%) and ended up with the following table. ![pivot table](/screenshots/goaltable.PNG) When I created a line graph of the new table, it matched the example perfectly. The last step was formatting my chart correctly.  Initially, my x-axis labels were meaningless numbers and I did not know how to make the labels reflect the goal ranges but I searched in the excel support and found [this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/change-the-display-of-chart-axes-422c97af-1483-4bad-a3db-3a9ef630b5a9) that walked me through the problem. It ended up being easy to fix using the select data tab in chart design. This table can be seen in my resources file. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The first conclusion that I can draw is that, while the frequency of failed campaigns remains relatively stable across each month of the year, projects seem to be successful with much more frequency when launched between May-July. Meanwhile, campaigns for theatre projects are very rarely cancelled. This would suggest that one's chances of success increase if they launch during one of these three months. 

The second conclusion I can draw is that there is a larger number of campaigns launched overall from May to July on average.  This may suggest that, while one's likelihood of success is higher during May, June and July, they will also face a larger number of campaigns competing for funding. Based on this, it might be wise to plan to launch during this period but plan a greater marketing effort to increase the odds that one's campaign is seen amongst the larger crowd.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I can conclude that the likelihood of a successful campaign increases substantially when its funding goal is less than $5,000. However, when the goal dips above $5,000, the rate at which campaigns succeed trends lower at a fairly slow pace until the goal reaches $25,000. At this point, the likelihood of success plummets; however, it takes a small jump above the probability of failure for campaigns with funding goals between 35,000 and 45000. Then, it plunges once again. There is quite a bit of fluctuation across the board, but the success rate decreases on average as funding goals increase. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The largest limitation of this data is that the campaign fundings goals have not been converted to a standard currency (such as USD). Instead, there are 13 different currencies whose exchange rate at the time of the goal I do not know. This makes comparisons of funding goals very misleading unless converted and very difficult to retroactively convert given the fluctuation of currency value. Another limitation of this data is that it doesn't contain any information on campaigns after February of 2017. Additionally, of the data collected, 78% of it was from campaigns from 2014-2016 (within the theatre category, this jumped to 95%). This could be a result of many things, such as a migration from an alternative crowd-funding platform to Kickstarter or increased support of crowd-funding overall. 
Another limitation of this dataset is the lack of campaigns in the theatre category with goals over $15,000. This may be because there is a better crowd-funding platform for theatre projects with large goals, or because that amount is rarely needed. Regardless, the small sample size makes graphical representations of various factors such as campaign outcome across funding goals misleading.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

One possible graph that we could make would be a depiction of campaign outcomes and overall frequency across the years. This would be more useful with more recent data, but it could show trends developing over time. Another graph could contrast the campaign outcomes of theatre and play outcomes to similar categories such as film and video to see if success and/or funding is higher and try to figure out if it's possible to learn from these campaigns or tap into their crowd support. 

Additionally, looking at the percentage funded could provide more information than simple outcomes. Specifically, percentage funded could be plotted across funding goals to establish whether campaigns with larger goals could be raising similar dollar amounts to campaigns with smaller goals at a higher rate. If so, it could inform strategies for calculating the average percent of funding acquired and determining a higher goal number to set to increase the odds of reaching the minimum required to fund the project. I'm sure this could pull up an ethical debate, but I would say that if the project received more funding than needed, it could use the support to create a better-finished project for its supporters.
